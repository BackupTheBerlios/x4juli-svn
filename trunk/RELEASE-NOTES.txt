                           Extensions for the Java Util Logging Implemenation (x4juli)
                                Version 0.7
                                Release Notes

WARNING:
============
x4juli version 0.7 is not meant to be used in production systems!
We already made intensive use of JUnit tests, findbugs, and checkstyle improvements,
due to that 0.7 brings a lot of quality.
To be sure that you can use x4juli from a later stable release, simply
use Logger.getLogger(Sample.class.getName()) from java.util.logging,
you will not have to change any code, due to this is recommended use.
Alternatively use an logging facade, i.E. Jakarta Commons Logging.
