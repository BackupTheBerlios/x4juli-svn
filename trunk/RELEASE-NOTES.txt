                           Extensions for the Java Util Logging Implemenation (x4juli)
                                Version 0.6
                                Release Notes

WARNING:
============
x4juli version 0.6 is not meant to be used in production systems!
To be sure that you can use x4juli from a later stable release, simply
use Logger.getLogger(Sample.class.getName()) from java.util.logging,
you will not have to change any code, due to this is recommended use.
Alternatively use an logging facade, i.E. Jakarta Commons Logging.

INTRODUCTION:
============

This document contains the release notes for this version of the x4juli package.  
It is primarily a service release for downstream users.

The following paragraphs document changes since the previous release
(version 0.5). The documentation (userguide and javadoc) 
has also been improved.


NEW FEATURES:
============

[ALL FILES]        
[Packages]         The package has moved from org.apache.juli to org.x4juli
                   because it will not be published at Apache. Maybe later :-)
[X4JuliLogManager] is now compatible with java.util.logging, Jakarta Commons Logging (JCL)
                   and the Simple Log Facade for Java (SLF4J).
[SLF4J]            x4juli delivers the slf4j classes as recommended on http://slf4j.org/faq.html#3
[JCLFactory]       can be used to get an logger with an static compiled approach.
[build.xml]        has been improved to correspond actual needs.
[samples]          There is one sample for a standalone application and three samples for use within Tomcat.

BUG FIXES:
=========

[MANIFEST.MF]      All jars include correct tags.
[License]          The sl4fj license has been included.
[RollingFileHandler] works now within an configuration environment
[I18N]             The x4juli internal logging has now a working i18n output

DEPRECATIONS:
============

    (These are carried forward from Version 0.5)

[org.apache.juli.FileHandler]        
                   Deprecated, replaced by org.apache.juli.handlers.FileHandler
                   or org.apache.juli.handlers.RollingFileHandler.
                   Class was also made final to make users change to new classes.
