<p>
The containing classes provide support for typesafe constants. x4juli does not
use them at any time because most constant strings/integers are used in performance critical
sections. This is not an argument against typesafe constants, they are very useful
in outside interfaced parts of any application. (Think of swing: everything is a int).
